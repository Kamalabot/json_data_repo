## Datasets in JSON Format
Json_data_repo is collection of datasets available in the wild, but in JSON format. 
When I started searching for reliable API points for the data I wanted, they were not
available. The datasets are distributed in CSV format, since that is easily viewable 
by everyone. Except csv formats are not native to Web, and the browsers don't speak CSV.

After a lot of research, learning and looking around the easiest solution to create a 
raw API point is through Github pages. This entire repo is only made of JSON data and 
will be continuously updated with data. 

### Company Progress Dataset:

https://kamalabot.github.io/json_data_repo/company_progress_db/location_data.json
https://kamalabot.github.io/json_data_repo/company_progress_db/location_monthly.json
https://kamalabot.github.io/json_data_repo/company_progress_db/monthly_data.json
https://kamalabot.github.io/json_data_repo/company_progress_db/product_data.json
https://kamalabot.github.io/json_data_repo/company_progress_db/product_monthly.json
https://kamalabot.github.io/json_data_repo/company_progress_db/reps_monthly.json
https://kamalabot.github.io/json_data_repo/company_progress_db/salesreps_data.json

The above links open up the json files inside the company_progress_db folder. Similarly
the data in other folders also can be opened. The links will be updated for all 
data upload. 

Have a great experience developing
